# Core Instructional Design Philosophy and Methodology
## 📜 My Philosophy
I approach instructional design as a process for ***engineering human performance***. By treating instructional design frameworks like ADDIE and 4-MAT as learning systems architecture, I build scalable enablement pipelines that minimize cognitive friction during the learning process. I've outlined my process below.
<br><br/>
## 🎻 Orchestrating the Development Lifecycle
### ADDIE & MVI
  * I implement and execute these instructional design and development lifecycle frameworks to build effective training events and "in-the-flow of work" enablement solutions.
    * The ***Analyze-Design-Develop-Implement-Evaluate (ADDIE)*** framework is implemented for building formal and structured event-driven learning solutions such as VILT/ILT, solo e-learnings, hands-on labs & simulations, and peer-to-peer learning "bootcamps".
    * For agile design cycles, I use what I like to call ***Minimum Viable Instruction (MVI)*** enablement solutions for “just-in-time” and “in-the-flow of work” bite-sized consumable learning artifacts including microlearnings, short videos, Github "docs-as-code", job aids, and quick reference guides.

## 📐 Designing the Blueprint
### 4-MAT
  * I apply the **4-MAT Structure** (WHY, WHAT, HOW, WHAT-IF) to map the learner’s journey through the learning event or enablement solution.
  * 4-MAT is ***elastic:*** it is applicable for building formal and structured event-driven (scaled up) learning solutions and for building "in-the-flow-of work" (scaled out) enablement solutions.

## ⚛️ Optimizing the Learning “Physics” Engine
### Cognitive Load Theory (CLT)
  * Intrinsic and Extraneous Load Balancing: “Cleaning” and structuring complex data and information into easily digestible input chunks and learning pathways so human working memory is not overwhelmed (i.e., experiencing a buffer overrun) during both event-driven training and when deploying enablement solutions
  * Germane Load Balancing: Dedicating maximum load to formative assessments and immediate hands-on application of learning materials during event-driven training (knowledge checks, hands-on labs, activities, peer-to-peer learning, hackathons) and when consuming enablement solutions in-the-flow-of-work (step-by-step instructions, visual workflow diagrams, output validation signals to look for)
<br><br/>
## 🚀 Building the Enablement Pipeline
### The Learning Ecosystem: 70/20/10
  * 10%: The Formal, Structured Event-Driven Training Sessions: Treating this as the “boot sequence” of the learning ecosystem to initialize baseline knowledge and skills
  * 70%: The In-the-Flow-of-Work Enablement Solutions: Treating this as the “experiential layer” of the learning ecosystem where just-in-time “firmware updates” are provided to remove blockers, thus avoiding the friction of context switching to a formal event-driven training session or course
  * 20%: Communities of Practice: Treating this as the “socialized layer” of the learning ecosystem where knowledge transfer occurs informally between peers and is supported by Slack/Teams/Discord channels or office hours
